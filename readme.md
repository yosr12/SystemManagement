#####################  ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM   
Overview:
The Energy Management System is a versatile and modular solution designed to manage the energy flow of a generic household. It optimizes electricity consumption, reduces costs, and minimizes carbon emissions by leveraging clean energy sources. The system can be easily configured to accommodate various combinations of components, making it scalable and adaptable to different scenarios.

Components.
The Energy Management System comprises the following components:

Consumer: Represents the household's energy consumption requirements.
CleanEnergyProducer: Includes clean energy sources such as solar panels.
Battery: Provides energy storage capabilities.
Grid: Represents access to the external electricity grid.
EnergyManagement: The core logic responsible for managing energy flow between components.

Usage:
To use the Energy Management System:

Configure the system by defining the desired combination of components.
Utilize the system's intelligence to optimize energy consumption.
Monitor energy flows and decisions in the log, recorded at five-minute intervals.
Example:
An example system configuration includes a clean energy producer (e.g., solar panels), a consumer (household), battery storage, and grid access. The system reads provided datasets and employs custom logic to minimize carbon emissions and costs.
